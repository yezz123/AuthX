## What is the purpose of this project?

- This Project is an Authentication Package helping to Add a Fully registration and authentication or authorization system to your FastAPI project. Is designed to be as customizable and adaptable as possible, so that you can use it as you want.

    For example, you can use it to create a simple authentication system for your FastAPI project, Or Provide a Cache Service for your MicroService or API to store the data in a database using Redis and MongoDB.

## How to use this project?

- Reading the documentation is the best way to get started, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me, I will try as much as possible to provide some real life example helping you to get started.

    For The Pythonist Reading the Code is the best way to understand it and Helping the maintainer to improve it. ü¶â

## What is the difference between the [FastAPI-User](https://github.com/fastapi-users/fastapi-users) & AuthenticationX?

- First, i would like to thanks [Fran√ßois Voron](https://github.com/frankie567) For his FastAPI-Users Project he helped me to understand Multiple things relate to Authentication Systems, and Building a good, fast, stable and scalable FastAPI application.

    Now for the difference, Here i provide more things that FastAPI-User have, for example:

    * Cache Services Using `Redis`.
    * Managing Social Authentication Using `httpX`.
    * Building a Helpful Addons like Captcha & String Checker.
    * Provide MongoDB as a Database.

    Lately, I see that FastAPI User Provide more Databases Services and ORM For example `SQLAlchemy` and `MongoDB` and `PostgreSQL`.

    Anyway, Both Projects are very similar, but FastAPI-User is more customizable and easy to use, and AuthenticationX is more customizable and but it is more complex to use ü¶•.

## How You Manage Your Projects?

Managing the project during my Work was somehow Hard for me, cause as many know I start this project after i finish my ex. Job, and i start working on it even if i joined my new Job as a Backend Developer for [@Obytes](https://obytes.com).

I Use a Trello Board to Manage my Projects, and i use Trello Cards to Manage my Work, check it here [https://trello.com/b/0NNZMP8T/authx](https://trello.com/b/0NNZMP8T/authx).

## Supporting Other Database Provider & ORM?

Until now, AuthX support only MongoDB, but i will try to support other Database Provider and ORM in the future, and i will try to provide a way to integrate Piccolo ORM also in the future.

## How to Support Project?

You can also financially support the author (me) through <a href="https://paypal.me/yassertahiri?locale.x=en_US" class="external-link" target="_blank">Paypal sponsors</a>.

There you could buy me a [coffee ‚òïÔ∏è](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tahiri) to say thanks. üòÑ

And you can also become a Silver or Gold sponsor for AuthX. üèÖüéâ
