# Social Models

## Define your Social Models

There are one Pydantic model variation provided as mixin:

- `SocialInCreate` â€“ social user model for creating.

You should define it, inheriting from the mixin:

```py
from authx.models import social

class Create(social.SocialInCreate):
    pass

class login(social.SocialInCreate):
    pass
```

!!! warning Take Care! you can't add any field to the model, because it's relate
to the third party of the Provider (ex. Facebook, Google, etc.)

Check the
[pydantic documentation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) for
more information.
