## Redis

**AuthX** provides the necessary tools to work with Redis cache thanks to [aio-libs/aioredis-py](https://github.com/aio-libs/aioredis-py) package for full async support.

## Setup Redis Cache

Let's create a Redis cache instance.

```py hl_lines="8-16"
{!./src/redis.py!}
```

!!! info
    - Redis cache is a `key-value` store that is often used as a distributed cache.
    - Also, Redis Cache is an optional feature of AuthX.

## Create the Cache adapter

The cache adapter of **AuthX** makes the link between your cache configuration and the users logic. It should be generated by a FastAPI dependency, and cached in the attribute.

```py hl_lines="5 21"
{!./src/redis.py!}
```
