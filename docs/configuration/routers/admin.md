# Administration Router

The Admin router will generate a set of endpoints for Administration
permissions.

- GET `/get_blacklist`
- POST `/toggle_blacklist`
- GET `/get_blackout`
- POST `/set_blackout`
- DELETE `/delete_blackout`
- GET `/get_id_by_username`
- POST `/kick`

## Setup The Administration Router

To Setup the Admin service, you will need to add all requirements to the object
`AdminService`.

```py
from typing import Callable, Optional
from authx.services.admin import AdminService
from authx.api import UsersRepo

AdminService.setup(
        repo = UserRepo,
        admin_required = Callable
    )
```

This one gonna help use to use the setup repository and the `admin_required`.

Let's Provide the `AdminService`:

```py
from authx import Authentication
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
auth = Authentication()

app.include_router(auth.admin_router, prefix="/api/users")
```

### Get Blacklist

As we know we will use the `GET` mehtod to get the blacklist, so we will need to
create a endpoint for this.

```py
@router.get(
        "/blacklist",
        name="admin:get_blacklist",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)]
    )
    async def get_blacklist():
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.get_blacklist()
```

The `service.get_blacklist()` method will return a list of usernames that are
blacklisted.

```py
async def get_blacklist(self) -> dict:
    return await self._repo.get_blacklist()
```

This one is based on `UsersManagementMixin` where we create a function that will
return a list of usernames that are blacklisted.

### Toggle Blacklist

As we know we will use the `POST` mehtod to toggle the blacklist, so we will
need to create a endpoint for this.

```py
@router.post(
        "/{id}/blacklist",
        name="admin:toggle_blacklist",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)],
    )
    async def toggle_blacklist(*, id: int):
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.toggle_blacklist(id)
```

The `service.toggle_blacklist(id)` method will toggle the blacklist of the user
with the given id.

```py
async def toggle_blacklist(self, id: int) -> None:
    return await self._repo.toggle_blacklist(id)
```

This one also is based on `UsersManagementMixin` where we create a function that
will toggle the blacklist of the user with the given id.

### Get Blackout

As we know we will use the `GET` mehtod to get the blackout, so we will need to
create a endpoint for this.

```py
@router.get(
        "/blackout",
        name="admin:get_blackout",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)]
    )
    async def get_blackout():
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.get_blackout()
```

The `service.get_blackout()` method will return a list of usernames that are
blacklisted, if an error it will raise an exception (404).

This one is based on `UsersManagementMixin`, but it return data from `redis`
cache that why **take Care**, and Configure your [redis](https://redis.io/)
server.

### Set Blackout

The `POST` mehtod to set the blackout, this one gonna set the blackout for the
user with the given id.

```py
@router.post(
        "/blackout",
        name="admin:set_blackout",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)]
    )
    async def set_blackout():
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.set_blackout()
```

Back to `service.set_blackout()` method, we will need to get the `id` from the
request, and the `time` from the request.

```py
async def set_blackout(self) -> None:
    epoch = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(0)
    ts = int((datetime.utcnow() - epoch).total_seconds()) + 10
    await self._repo.set_blackout(ts)
    return None
```

the `_repo.set_blackout(ts)` set the `ts` to the `redis` cache.

### Delete Blackout

The `DELETE` mehtod to delete the blackout, this one gonna delete the blackout
for the user with the given id.

```py
@router.delete(
        "/blackout",
        name="admin:delete_blackout",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)],
    )
    async def delete_blackout():
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.delete_blackout()
```

Now we could take a look at the `service.delete_blackout()` method.

```py
async def delete_blackout(self) -> None:
    await self._repo.delete_blackout()
```

At this point, the blackout will be deleted from the `redis` cache.

!!! info All of this is set on `redis` cache, so you need to configure your
[redis](https://redis.io/) server.

### Get ID By Username

Now, after we finish the Blacklist and Blackout, we will need to create a
endpoint to get the id of the user with the given username.

```py
@router.get(
        "/id_by_username",
        name="admin:get_id_by_username",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)],
    )
    async def get_id_by_username(*, username: str):
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.get_id_by_username(username)
```

Now to understand how this one works, we will need to create a function that
will return the id of the user with the given username, and this is
`service.get_id_by_username(username)` method.

```py
async def get_id_by_username(self, username: str) -> Optional[dict]:
    item = await self._repo.get_by_username(username)
    return {"id": item.get("id")}
```

We get the username from database, and if it is not found, we will return
`None`.

### Kick

For the kick, we will need to create a endpoint to kick the user with the given
id, this router need a `POST` method.

```py
@router.post(
        "/{id}/kick",
        name="admin:kick",
        dependencies=[Depends(admin_required)]
    )
    async def kick(*, id: int):
        service = AdminService()
        return await service.kick(id)
```

As we see, we will need to get the id from the request, and then we will call
the `service.kick(id)` method.

```py
async def kick(self, id: int) -> None:
    await self._repo.kick(id)
```

And this will kick the user with the given id, but need to take care, if the
user is not found, we will raise an exception (404).

Also, this need the Key relate to cache, and the `_access_expiration` is the
time that the user will be kicked.

!!! Warning Configure your [redis](https://redis.io/) server, or check this
[redis Configuration](../cache/index.md).
