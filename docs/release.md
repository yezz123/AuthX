### What's Changed

For detailed information on the changes introduced in this release, please refer to the [Full Changelog](https://github.com/yezz123/authx/compare/0.9.0...1.0.0b0)

## 0.9.1

### üü•  LAST RELEASE FOR AUTHX - 0.x.x

As you may observe, my primary shift has been towards concentrating on the development of the new release, with a strong emphasis on incorporating features that users would appreciate to enhance authentication capabilities.

In doing so, I have intentionally omitted several functions. This is why I strongly believe that having two distinct versions is truly beneficial.

#### 0.x.x

The primary focus will be on addressing bug fixes and improving documentation in the previous version. It appears that the excessive use of dependencies may have been a factor that many people did not appreciate.

You can open a pull request in case you want to fix something related to it üôåüèª

#### 1.x.x

You can read here what is new until now:

### Implementation in FastAPI applications

Thats Work by adding a Middleware to your FastAPI application, work on collecting prometheus metrics for each request, and then to handle that we need a function `get_metrics` work on handling exposing the prometheus metrics into `/metrics` endpoint.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from authx.middleware import MetricsMiddleware, get_metrics

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(MetricsMiddleware)
app.add_route("/metrics", get_metrics)
```

### Idea

Profiling is a technique to figure out how time is spent in a program. With
these statistics, we can find the ‚Äúhot spot‚Äù of a program and think about ways
of improvement. Sometimes, a hot spot in an unexpected location may also hint at
a bug in the program.

> Pyinstrument is a Python profiler. A profiler is a tool to help you optimize
> your code - make it faster.

### Profile a web request in FastAPI

To profile call stacks in FastAPI, you can write a middleware extension for
`pyinstrument`.

Create an async function and decorate it with `app.middleware('http')` where the
app is the name of your FastAPI application instance.

Make sure you configure a setting to only make this available when required.

```py
from pyinstrument import Profiler
PROFILING = True  # Set this from a settings model
if PROFILING:
    @app.middleware("http")
    async def profile_request(request: Request, call_next):
        profiling = request.query_params.get("profile", False)
        if profiling:
            profiler = Profiler(interval=settings.profiling_interval, async_mode="enabled")
            profiler.start()
            await call_next(request)
            profiler.stop()
            return HTMLResponse(profiler.output_html())
        else:
            return await call_next(request)
```

To invoke, make any request to your application with the GET parameter
`profile=1` and it will print the HTML result from `pyinstrument`.

### AuthX's Support

With AuthX the abstract of profiling is easy, it's just about calling the
`ProfilerMiddleware` 's class and calling it in
`add_middleware(ProfilerMiddleware)` func that FastAPI provides.

#### Example

```py
import os
import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from authx import ProfilerMiddleware
app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(ProfilerMiddleware)
@app.get("/test")
async def normal_request():
    return JSONResponse({"retMsg": "Hello World!"})
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app_name = os.path.basename(__file__).replace(".py", "")
    uvicorn.run(app=f"{app_name}:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, workers=1)
```

## 0.5.0

Supporting SocketIO that's allows bi-directional communication between client
and server. Bi-directional communications are enabled when a client has
Socket.IO in the browser, and a server has also integrated the Socket.IO
package. While data can be sent in a number of forms, JSON is the simplest.

### Usage

To add SocketIO support to FastAPI all you need to do is import `AuthXSocket`
and pass it `FastAPI` object.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from authx import AuthXSocket

app = FastAPI()
socket = AuthXSocket(app=app)
```

you can import `AuthXSocket` object that exposes most of the SocketIO
functionality.

```python
@AuthXSocket.on('leave')
async def handle_leave(sid, *args, **kwargs):
    await AuthXSocket.emit('lobby', 'User left')
```

### Working with distributed applications

When working with distributed applications, it is often necessary to access the
functionality of the Socket.IO from multiple processes. As a solution to the
above problems, the Socket.IO server can be configured to connect to a message
queue such as `Redis` or `RabbitMQ`, to communicate with other related Socket.IO
servers or auxiliary workers.

Refer this link for more details
[using-a-message-queue](https://python-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/server.html#using-a-message-queue)

```python

import socketio
from fastapi import FastAPI
from authx import AuthXSocket

app = FastAPI()

redis_manager = socketio.AsyncRedisManager('redis://')

socket_manager = AuthXSocket(app=app, client_manager=redis_manager)
```

## HTTPCache

### Overview

HTTP caching occurs when the browser stores local copies of web resources for
faster retrieval the next time the resource is required. As your application
serves resources it can attach cache headers to the response specifying the
desired cache behavior.

![Overview](https://devcenter1.assets.heroku.com/article-images/782-imported-1443570279-782-imported-1443554749-55-original.jpg)

When an item is fully cached, the browser may choose to not contact the server
at all and simply use its cached copy:

![Overview](https://devcenter1.assets.heroku.com/article-images/782-imported-1443570282-782-imported-1443554751-54-original.jpg)

### HTTP cache headers

There are two primary cache headers, `Cache-Control` and `Expires`.

#### Cache-Control

The `Cache-Control` header is the most important header to set as it effectively
`switches on` caching in the browser. With this header in place, and set with a
value that enables caching, the browser will cache the file for as long as
specified. Without this header, the browser will re-request the file on each
subsequent request.

#### Expires

When accompanying the `Cache-Control` header, Expires simply sets a date from
which the cached resource should no longer be considered valid. From this date
forward the browser will request a fresh copy of the resource.

> This Introduction to HTTP Caching is based on the
> [HTTP Caching Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching).

AuthX provides a simple HTTP caching model designed to work with
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/),

### Initialize the cache

```python
from authx import HTTPCache
from pytz import timezone

africa_Casablanca = timezone('Africa/Casablanca')
HTTPCache.init(redis_url=REDIS_URL, namespace='test_namespace', tz=africa_Casablanca)
```

### Session

This is a supported Redis Based Session Storage for your FastAPI Application,
you can use it with any Session Backend.

```sh
pip install authx[session]
```

**Note**: The requirements in `authx[redis]` are not the same used in Sessions
features.

#### Features

---

* [x] Dependency injection to protect routes
* [x] Compatible with FastAPI's auto-generated docs
* [x] Pydantic models for verifying session data
* [x] Abstract session backend so you can build one that fits your needs
* [x] Abstract frontends to choose how you extract the session ids (cookies,
      header, etc.)
* [x] Create verifiers based on the session data.
* [x] Compatible with any Redis Configuration.

##### Redis Configuration

Before setting up our Sessions Storage and our CRUD Backend, we need to
configure our Redis Instance.

`BasicConfig` is a function that helps us set up the Instance Information like
Redis Link Connection or ID Name or Expiration Time.

###### Default Config

* [x] url of Redis: `redis://localhost:6379/0`
* [x] name of sessionId: `ssid`
* [x] generator function of `sessionId`: `lambda :uuid.uuid4().hex`
* [x] expire time of session in redis: `6 hours`

```py
import random
from datetime import timedelta
from authx.cache import basicConfig

basicConfig(
    redisURL="redis://localhost:6379/1",
    sessionIdName="sessionId",
    sessionIdGenerator=lambda: str(random.randint(1000, 9999)),
    expireTime=timedelta(days=1),
)
```

### Release Notes

Finally, we drop the full support from MongoDB Thanks to @stephane That's
implemented some functionality under the name of `BaseDBBackend` and Create some
Database Crud Functionality without a database.

* Database Plugins:

  * MongoDB: Using MongoDB as a Database Backend is now supported as a plugin
    based on `BaseDBBackend`.
  * EncodeDB: Databases give you simple asyncio support for a range of
    databases.

    It allows you to make queries using the powerful `SQLAlchemy Core`
    expression language and provides support for `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, and
    `SQLite`.

    We can now provide some SQL queries to the database on the top of
    `BaseDBBackend`.

### MongoDB

```python
from authx import MongoDBBackend
```

### EncodeDB

```python
from authx import EncodeDBBackend
```

**Note**: Don't forget to set up the database connection as a client that will
be functioned under pre-built Methods.

* Improve the package by Switching to `flit` to build the package.
  * Improve Workflow and integrate `codecov.yml`.
  * Use the issue of new Functionalities in Github.
  * Create New Directory called `scripts` to store the shell scripts to run
    tests or linting.
* Improve Importing the package
  <https://github.com/yezz123/authx/blob/main/authx/__init__.py>.
  * Calling the function or the class directly from the `__init__.py` file.
* Improve Documentation, and Describe different new Addons, that AuthX now
  provide such as new Database Backends or Plugins or the new middleware
  add-ons, Thanks to @AbderrahimSoubaiElidrissi
* Update and upgrade Dependencies.
* Inline and improve IDLE Support.

## What's Changed

### Middleware - Oauth2

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is a protocol that allows a user to grant
a third-party website or application access to the user's protected resources,
without necessarily revealing their long-term credentials or even their
identity.

Starlette middleware for authentication through oauth2's via a secret key, which
is often used to add authentication and authorization to a web application that
interacts with an API on behalf of the user.

That's why AuthX provides a Configuration `MiddlewareOauth2` to configure the
OAuth2 middleware.

```py
from authx import MiddlewareOauth2

class AuthenticateMiddleware(MiddlewareOauth2):
    PUBLIC_PATHS = {"/public"}
```

### Code Enhancement
