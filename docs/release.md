# Release Notes üéû

## 0.1.2

After this discussion #124 with [@stephane](https://github.com/stephane) we need to change the package name that what pep's rules provide.

> Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability. Python packages should also have short, all-lowercase names, although the use of underscores is discouraged.
